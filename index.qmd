I have a solid foundation in molecular biology, genetics, and microbiology, with a keen interest in data science and bioinformatics. I'm passionate about using my molecular and computational skills to tackle infectious diseases, with a special focus on emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens such as Dengue virus and SARS-CoV-2. As a team player, I excel in collaborating with both wet and dry lab researchers and engaging diverse audiences.
